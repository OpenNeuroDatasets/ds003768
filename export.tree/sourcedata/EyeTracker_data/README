This dataset includes 26 healthy participants who were recruited at Penn State, with informed consent obtained. This dataset contains eye-tracking data that were collected simultaneously with EEG and BOLD signals. Eye-tracking data were recorded at a sampling rate of 60 Hz . The EyeTracker data was stored and organized in individual folders, each corresponding to a specific participant.

Each scanning section consisted of an anatomical session, two 10-min resting-state sessions, and several 15-min sleep sessions. The first resting-state session was conducted before a visual-motor adaptation task (Albouy et al, Journal of Sleep Research, 2013) and the second resting-state session was conducted after a visual-motor adaptation task.

The XDAT column in each text file defines the structure of the dataset, marking session transitions and subject responses:
•XDAT = 0 Separates all sessions.
•XDAT = 1 Represents resting-state sessions or sleep sessions without button press.
•XDAT = 2 Represents the button press, indicating that the subject remained awake during a sleep session.
